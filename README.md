# personal-blog

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to work ho using html, css, and javascript to create a form that inputs into a page for blog posts. This project was very useful because I had to deep dive on a few elements that I'm sure will be useful in the future. These include saving to local storage and learning how to code a functioning dark/light-mode toggle button. I'm still struggling with organizing flex boxes, as can be seen on the blog page itself - and I am also having trouble getting the input text to display on the 2nd html page (passing input from the landing page that persists in local storage to the blog page). I can see the inputs in the console, so I know they're making thair way into local storage, but more practice on my part is needed to figure out how to set them on the blog page. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
